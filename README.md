### Heart Attack Risk Prediction
I've developed a machine learning model to predict heart health conditions, specifically classifying whether a user is prone to a heart attack. Leveraging the power of AWS/Heroku for deployment (yet to be achieved) and Docker for containerization, I've streamlined the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This allows users to easily access and utilize the predictive capabilities of the model. The combination of these technologies not only ensures efficiency in deployment but also facilitates a scalable and user-friendly experience for individuals concerned about their heart health.
