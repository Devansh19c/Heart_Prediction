### Heart Attack Risk Prediction

Developed a Machine Learning model to predict heart health conditions, specifically classifying whether a user is prone to a heart attack. Leveraging the power of AWS for deployment and Docker for containerization, I've streamlined the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). This allows us to simultaneously carry out the changes and deployment procedures. The combination of these technologies not only ensures efficiency in deployment but also facilitates a scalable WebApplication.
